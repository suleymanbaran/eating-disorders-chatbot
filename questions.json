[{"question":" What are the symptoms of anorexia nervosa?",
"answer":"Anorexia nervosa is a syndrome characterized by maintaining a low weight due to an intense focus on body weight, either as a fear of fatness or pursuit of thinness. Diagnosis involves weight at least 15% below the expected or a body mass index (BMI) below 17.5 kg/m² in adults. Weight loss is often induced by avoiding 'fattening foods,' excessive exercise, or self-induced purging. Poor nutrition leads to endocrine disorders, affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The subjective experience of anorexia may differ from external assessments, with strong convictions about weight control. Weight loss is seen as a positive achievement, reinforcing low confidence and poor self-esteem. The role of 'weight phobia' is debated, and the disorder may start with seemingly harmless dieting that intensifies over time. Secondary difficulties include physical effects, social isolation, and interference with education or employment. While concerned family members or professionals often initiate seeking help, some individuals may recognize the disorder's harmful effects and seek help independently. Children and adolescents are typically brought to treatment by others, presenting diagnostic challenges." },
{"question":" How anorexia nervosa can be diagnosed?",
"answer":" Diagnosing anorexia nervosa in older adolescents and adults is generally straightforward, contingent on the individual's​​ willingness to disclose motives, symptoms, and behaviors. A supportive assessment interview is crucial for revealing fears about weight, dieting, and maladaptive behaviors. Secondary amenorrhea or physical signs of starvation in women should raise suspicion. Diagnosis in children and younger adolescents can be challenging due to insufficiently developmentally sensitive criteria. Diagnosis relies on history, often supported by corroborative accounts, along with physical examination, BMI calculation, and observation of characteristic behaviors. Physical investigations are essential for assessing the disorder's impact and complications. Comorbid physical disorders like diabetes or chronic bowel/thyroid issues present diagnostic challenges. Weight loss in depression-related anorexia differs from anorexia nervosa but may overlap with chronic fatigue syndromes or brain tumors, leading to potential misdiagnoses."},
{"question":" What are the physical and social consequences of anorexia nervosa?",
"answer":"Over time, emotional difficulties increase, accompanied by physical and social challenges, such as self-care inadequacy, interruption of leisure activities, and the loss of personal autonomy. Comorbid diagnoses, such as depression (up to 63%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (35%), are frequent. Physical problems arise from starvation and purging behavior, affecting various body systems, including musculo-skeletal, endocrine, and reproductive systems. Anorexia nervosa patients may experience weakness, bone density loss, infertility, and hormonal imbalances. Brain volume reduction is observed in anorexia nervosa, with persistent grey matter deficits even after weight gain. Cognitive deficits are often restored after weight recovery, but some abnormalities in executive function may persist. The long-term effects of extreme weight loss on brain development in children are not well understood, potentially impacting cognitive functioning. Social difficulties may lead to continued dependence on family, hinder intimate relationships, and adversely affect employment prospects due to disorder limitations or hospitalization disruptions."},
{"question":" What are the symptoms of bulimia nervosa?",
"answer":"Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like vomiting, fasting, or excessive exercise to prevent weight gain. Self-evaluation is influenced by body shape and weight. The diagnosis prioritizes anorexia nervosa, with bulimia nervosa maintaining a BMI above 17.5 kg/m² in adults. Some controversy exists regarding including those who binge eat without purging. People with bulimia nervosa often do not readily disclose their behavior or seek treatment, and the condition is subjectively less 'valued' than anorexia nervosa, accompanied by extreme guilt and shame. Onset is typically at a slightly older age than anorexia nervosa, often arising from attempts to restrain eating. Bulimia nervosa involves reactive binge eating and compensatory purging, leading to a cycle of attempted dieting. Bulimic episodes are frequently planned, with individuals becoming preoccupied with thoughts of food. Mood disturbance, anxiety, and tension are common, and self-denigratory thoughts may develop. A significant proportion of those with bulimia nervosa have a history of disturbed interpersonal relationships, poor impulse control, and may abuse alcohol and drugs."},
{"question":"How bulimia nervosa can be diagnosed?",
"answer":"In diagnosing bulimia nervosa, obtaining a comprehensive history, supported by corroborative accounts, is crucial. Individuals may report physical complaints such as fatigue, lethargy, bloating, constipation, abdominal pain, and irregular menstruation. Erosion of dental enamel, especially on the lingual surface of upper teeth, is associated with vomiting. Physical examination is often normal, but enlarged salivary glands and calluses on the hand from inducing vomiting may be present. Physical complications in bulimia nervosa are generally fewer than anorexia nervosa, but initial complaints are common. Common physical issues include enlarged salivary glands, calluses, oedema, electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic alkalosis, and dehydration. Gastrointestinal problems like oesophagitis, constipation, and, rarely, gastric dilatation leading to rupture may occur. Laxative abuse can cause cardiomyopathy and myopathic disorders. Electrocardiography may reveal heart conduction abnormalities. Abnormal electroencephalographic findings are linked to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, but no association with epilepsy is noted. Endocrine abnormalities vary, affecting the menstrual cycle and thyroid and growth hormone responses to thyroid-releasing hormone. Overall, about 10% of individuals with bulimia nervosa have electrolyte abnormalities detected on routine screening."},
{"question":" What is the physical and social consequences of bulimia nervosa?",
"answer":" In the long-term consequences of bulimia nervosa, there is significant overlap with anorexia nervosa. Mood and anxiety symptoms are common, contributing to low self-esteem and body image disturbance. These factors negatively impact social relationships, often characterized by impulsivity and chaotic lifestyles. The adverse physical effects of purging, detailed in Section 7.5.2, include the risk of alternating weight loss and gain. Long-term consequences of bulimia nervosa may involve increased mortality and morbidity from coronary heart disease, as seen in studies by Lissner et al. (1991). Weight variability is associated with higher all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality. The prevalence of personality disorders in individuals with bulimia nervosa varies widely, ranging from 21% to 77%. Frequently observed are obsessive-compulsive and avoidant personality disorders (Cluster C). The relationship between bulimia nervosa and borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been debated, with reported rates ranging from 2% to 47%. However, subject and measurement variability across studies suggest that BPD probably occurs no more frequently than other personality disorders in bulimia nervosa."},


{"question":" What are the symptoms of binge eating disorder?",
"answer":" The main symptom of binge eating disorder is eating a lot of food in a short time and not being able to stop when full. Other symptoms include:eating when not hungry; eating very fast during a binge ;eating alone or secretly; feeling depressed, guilty, ashamed, or disgusted after binge eating. People who regularly eat in this way may have binge eating disorder."},
{"question":" What are the treatment options for binge eating disorder?",
"answer":"Most people recover from binge eating disorder with the right support and treatment, but it may take time. The main treatments are: guided self-help programmes, a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which is in group sessions or individual (1-on-1) sessions"},
{"question":"What are the causes of binge eating disorder?",
"answer":" The exact causes of binge eating disorder are not known, but you are more likely to have an eating disorder if: you or a member of your family has a history of eating disorders, depression, or alcohol or drug misuse, you're too worried about being slim, particularly if you also feel pressure from society or your job, for example, ballet dancers, models or athletes , you have anxiety, low self-esteem, an obsessive personality or are a perfectionist, you've experienced a stressful event or trauma"},
{"question":"What are the symptoms of atypical eating disorders?",
"answer":" A number of people suffer from eating disorders that closely resemble anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, but which are considered atypical, as they do not meet the precise diagnostic criteria for these conditions . In Europe, these are often termed ‘atypical eating disorders’, the equivalent American term being ‘eating disorders not otherwise specified’. For example, the patient’s weight might be just above the diagnostic threshold for anorexia nervosa or she might still be menstruating. Binge eating and purging may occur less frequently than specified for a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Overconcern with weight and shape is generally present in these disorders, although in some the primary focus is on maintaining strict control over eating. Although the diagnostic criteria may not be met, many atypical eating disorders are as severe and long-lasting as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Patients’ treatment needs and prognosis may be virtually identical."},
{"question":" How atypical eating disorders can be diagnosed?", "answer":" Atypical eating disorders do not fit the criteria for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. An example is extreme dietary restraint and excessive exercise to maintain low-normal weight. Some individuals with atypical eating disorders have a history of anorexia or bulimia. Compared to anorexia and bulimia, less is known about binge eating disorder (BED). BED, characterized by binge eating, has a distinct profile. Onset is typically in teenage years or early 20s, but presentation often occurs in the 30s or 40s with overweight or obesity. Binge eating is associated with overeating rather than dietary restraint. Many with BED are obese, and self-induced vomiting or laxative misuse is rare. Depressive features and dissatisfaction with body shape are common, but weight and shape concerns are less pronounced than in bulimia nervosa. Diagnosis is based on history, with physical investigations assessing consequences. Hospital observation is seldom needed, but meal assessment may aid treatment planning in day programs."},
{"question":" What are the key priorities for implementation of anorexia nervosa?", "answer":"Most adults with anorexia nervosa should be managed on an outpatient basis with psychological treatment provided by a service that is competent in giving that treatment and assessing the physical risk of people with eating disorders. People with anorexia nervosa requiring inpatient treatment should normally be admitted to a setting that can provide the skilled implementation of refeeding with careful physical monitoring (particularly in the first few days of refeeding) and in combination with psychosocial interventions. Family interventions that directly address the eating disorder should be offered to children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa."}, {"question":" What are the key priorities for implementation of bulimia nervosa?", "answer":"As a possible first step, patients with bulimia nervosa should be encouraged to follow an evidence-based self-help programme. As an alternative or additional first step to using an evidence-based self-help programme, adults with bulimia nervosa may be offered a trial of an antidepressant drug. Cognitive behavior therapy for bulimia nervosa (CBT-BN), a specifically adapted form of CBT, should be offered to adults with bulimia nervosa. The course of treatment should be for 16 to 20 sessions over four to five months. Adolescents with bulimia nervosa may be treated with CBT-BN, adapted as needed to suit their age, circumstances, and level of development, and including the family as appropriate."},


{"question":" What are the key priorities for implementation of atypical eating disorders?", "answer":"In the absence of evidence to guide the management of atypical eating disorders (also known as eating disorders not otherwise specified) other than binge eating disorder, it is recommended that the clinician considers following the guidance on the treatment of the eating problem that most closely resembles the individual patient’s eating disorder. Cognitive behavior therapy for binge eating disorder (CBT-BED), a specifically adapted form of CBT, should be offered to adults with binge eating disorder."},


{"question":" I am worried that I have an unhealthy relationship with food, How can I understand if I have an eating disorder.", "answer":"If you or people around you are worried that you have an unhealthy relationship with food, you could have an eating disorder. Symptoms of eating disorders include: spending a lot of time worrying about your weight and body shape avoiding socializing when you think food will be involved eating very little food making yourself sick or taking laxatives after you eat exercising too much having very strict habits or routines around food changes in your mood such as being withdrawn, anxious or depressed You may also notice physical signs, including: feeling cold, tired or dizzy pains, tingling or numbness in your arms and legs (poor circulation) feeling your heart racing, fainting or feeling faint problems with your digestion, such as bloating, constipation or diarrhoea your weight being very high or very low for someone of your age and height not getting your period or other delayed signs of puberty"}]
